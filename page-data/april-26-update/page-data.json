Let's try to get caught up.</p>\n<p>It seems like NavMesh is the feature that I need to use for click-to-navigate functionality. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHV1ymlw-P8\">Brackeys NavMesh Tutorial</a> works based on clicking a location in the game world. I want to create a floating menu that includes locations.</p>\n<p>I still need to prototype interactions. I'll dive into Unity Learn for this. To start, I want an interaction with the MRI machine that gives a brief explanation of what it does and an interaction with the scale to show the player's  weight.</p>\n<p>I expected that I'd be further along by now; this has been humbling. Perhaps teaching Linux this semester wasn't a good idea. (It wasn't a good idea.)</p>\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> an in-game menu system to click and navigate throughout the game world, rather than using typical controls.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" checked disabled> Apple Developer account configuration</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> deploy game to iPad/iPhone</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> deploy game to Android tablet</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> add music and sound effects</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> a startup menu</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"April 26","date":"April 26, 2023","description":"Interaction, Click to Navigate, and Menu-based player navigation."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/april-21-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 21"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/april-27-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 27"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fdfb109c-0536-5fb8-82ba-fb9b5171563e","previousPostId":"5f76a258-574b-5462-b5b5-c1d1103727b7","nextPostId":"b069af83-b28d-590d-99c3-7f5797827c31"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
