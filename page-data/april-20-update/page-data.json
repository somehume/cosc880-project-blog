I won't go into much detail about this, as the info is available on the linked pages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/publishing-for-ios#\">Unity Learn: Publishing for iOS</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/help/account/create-certificates/create-a-certificate-signing-request\">Apple Developer: Create a Certificate Signing Request</a></p>\n<h3>Apple Developer Requirements</h3>\n<p>If you follow the above two links, you'll see that a CSR needs to be generated, to download the certificate from Apple. Fortunately I'm a Mac user. I'm not sure if this would be possible from Windows.</p>\n<p>After generating the certificate, I had to generate an App ID and an App Store Provisioning Profile.</p>\n<h3>Unity Publishing Settings</h3>\n<p>There are also some changes to the Build Settings in the Unity Editor that need to match the information given to Apple during the process of generating the certificate, App ID and Provisioning Profile.</p>\n<p>Following the instructions on Unity Learn, I ran into an issue with the Target SDK needing to be set to Device SDK due to my not currently having an iOS device that I can use for development. I hope to acquire one soon. I also forgot where this was set, so I spent an embarrising amount of time in Xcode attempting to change back to the simulator.</p>\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> an in-game menu system to click and navigate throughout the game world, rather than using typical controls.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" checked disabled> Apple Developer account configuration</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> load content onto iPad/iPhone</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> add music and sound effects</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> a startup menu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Latest WebGL Build: <a href=\"https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-6ej\">https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-6ej</a></p>\n<p>Advisor: <a href=\"https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/computerinfosci/facultystaff/ztang.html\">Dr. Ziying Tang</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"April 20","date":"April 20, 2023","description":"Now to revisit iOS as a build target."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/april-13-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 13"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"273210c7-7dbe-5631-9fe5-37975c1affc9","previousPostId":"17faa46a-ab91-58e9-80b3-344a16eea42f","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
