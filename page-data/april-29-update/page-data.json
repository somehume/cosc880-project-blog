I want to keep the content since I worked on it and it may prove to be useful in the future for something. I currently have 8 projects in my main branch. I initially thought that I'd clean it up by using a branch for each project. I'm now thinking to create a branch to store all tutorials, and another for archives of the earlier game dev attempts. The updated repo should be something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">main</code> : currently released game build</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">tutorials</code> : follow along content for tutorials to help with adding features to the game or learning the dev environment</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">archive</code> : my old content</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">dev</code> : working branch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the sake of sanity, I'll delete everything that shouldn't be in a branch except the final game, verify that the <code class=\"language-text\">dev</code> branch is doing what it should do, then go back and remove the game from the <code class=\"language-text\">archive</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tutorials</code> branches.</p>\n<h3>Main and Dev</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>MedicalCenter</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Archive</h3>\n<p>Archive will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Doors</li>\n<li>HospitalCorridor</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tutorials will include</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Level</li>\n<li>Maze</li>\n<li>Player</li>\n<li>FPS_Tutorial</li>\n<li>UnityEssentialsMicrogame</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I was in the process of cleaning up, I glanced at the sizes of the other projects. In total, the projects other than the actual game are under 700 MB. This doesn't save me much, but it is still less than what I needed for the final project. I'll look at trimming unused assets and packages from the final project at some point.</p>\n<p>-I can only imagine that this would be very confusing for Unity Hub, if Unity Hub was a real boy._ Actually, it just removed the projects that weren't available. Either way, the <code class=\"language-text\">dev</code> branch is the last to commit, besides the <code class=\"language-text\">main</code> branch. I may actually just leave everything in <code class=\"language-text\">main</code>. I am curious about what'll happen when I do a pull request to main. That reminds me that I can now enable the protection features.</p>\n<p>I may actually be able to get rid of some of these and still be able to sleep at night, but that isn't a part of the current task. I'll review that some time in the future.</p>\n<h3>GPG Keys and GitHub (Side quest)</h3>\n<p>As a result of looking into securing my <code class=\"language-text\">main</code> branch, I just went down the rabbit hole of keysigning commits to update my GPG key on GitHub.</p>\n<h2>Interaction</h2>\n<p>My initial idea was to have a menu system to allow the player to select the next game objective. Now I'm thinking that adding a map in the lobby to trigger the menu might be a nice effect; it may also be less complicated.</p>\n<p>It seems that I can use the NavMesh feature for automatic navigation as well as a wayfinding pointer. I need to try this in practice.</p>\n<p>The interaction looks like it'll take some doing, so I'll start with the NavMesh.</p>\n<h2>Simplify play area</h2>\n<p>Dr. Tang mentioned that I may have too many rooms. To simplify, I can add some doors that cannot be opened. Perhaps I can add some sort of barrier, like caution tape, to prevent the player from reaching certain regions of the level.</p>\n<h2>Final report and Presentation</h2>\n<p>I have just under 2 weeks before I present. I need to create my slide deck and write my final report.</p>\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> an in-game menu system to click and navigate throughout the game world, rather than exclusively using typical controls.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Add a path guide to show the player where to go next.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> add interaction between player and game objects</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" checked disabled> Apple Developer account configuration</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Add a ceiling and lighting</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> deploy game to iPad/iPhone</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> deploy game to Android tablet</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> add music and sound effects</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> a startup menu</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> add source documentation</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> prepare slides</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" checked disabled> request paper</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> cleanup repo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Latest WebGL Build: <a href=\"https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-6ej\">https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-6ej</a></p>\n<p>Advisor: <a href=\"https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/computerinfosci/facultystaff/ztang.html\">Dr. Ziying Tang</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"April 29","date":"April 29, 2023","description":"Repo cleanup, interaction, and final report."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/april-27-update/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 27"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"0bd87d9d-54b5-5b76-88e1-7a5cff0d3ec2","previousPostId":"b069af83-b28d-590d-99c3-7f5797827c31","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
