description: "Interaction, Click to Navigate, and Menu-based player navigation."
---

I lost a week due to allergy complications. Let's try to get caught up.

It seems like NavMesh is the feature that I need to use for click-to-navigate functionality. [Brackeys NavMesh Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHV1ymlw-P8) works based on clicking a location in the game world. I want to create a floating menu that includes locations.

I still need to prototype interactions. I'll dive into Unity Learn for this. To start, I want an interaction with the MRI machine that gives a brief explanation of what it does and an interaction with the scale to show the player's  weight.

I expected that I'd be further along by now; this has been humbling. Perhaps teaching Linux this semester wasn't a good idea. (It wasn't a good idea.)

### TODO 
- [ ] an in-game menu system to click and navigate throughout the game world, rather than using typical controls.
- [X] Apple Developer account configuration
- [ ] deploy game to iPad/iPhone
- [ ] deploy game to Android tablet
- [ ] add music and sound effects
- [ ] a startup menu
