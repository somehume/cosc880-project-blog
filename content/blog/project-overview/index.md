This project is in part an exploration of modern game development tools and techniques, and part a prototype for a game that aims to introduce autistic children to medical procedures prior to experiencing the procedure.

This blog is a bit of a late start at centrally documenting this project. My prior game development experience was as an undergraduate student in University of Baltimore's Simulation and Digital Entertainment (now Simulation and Game Design) program. The majority of my game dev experience was using Unreal 2.5, Macromedia Flash and modding Neverwinter Nights. This project is built using Unity.

This site was built using a Gatsby blog [template](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) which supports markdown files to "feed" the blog.
