description: "Let's try Android."

I'd recently been attempting to get setup for deploying the prototype game to iOS, running into a wall upon realizing that I don't have a device that I can use with the development mode due to my device being used for my day job. I'll endeavor to source a dedicated development device.

I do have an low spec Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab A6) that can hopefully be useful for this project. I'll start working on this today.


### TODO 
- [ ] an in-game menu system to click and navigate throughout the game world, rather than using typical controls.
- [X] Apple Developer account configuration
- [ ] deploy game to iPad/iPhone
- [ ] deploy game to Android tablet
- [ ] add music and sound effects
- [ ] a startup menu
